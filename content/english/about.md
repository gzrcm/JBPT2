Don’t like what you see in the mirror and go out of your way to cover up your body? Then do you feel like you don’t have the time, the energy or the guidance to get fit? Think it will take years? Maybe you have tried, several times, to get fit and it always fizzles out. If you can relate to these statements you’re in the right place, and it's time to make a permanent change to your health and fitness, just like I did. Have a look at these before and after photos.

I'm JB, and I used to be in very poor health. I was very overweight, at my biggest I was 17 stone (that's 108 kilograms for you metric lot). I was low energy, ashamed of the way I looked. I was in a dark place with two options; continue on my path of despair and self-destruction or climb my way out. I said enough was enough. Something had to change, I had to change.

That journey started over 13 years ago, and over that time I learned a lot. I didn’t have a coach, a plan, any idea what I was doing really, I was just driven to escape the whole I had dug for myself. Then the conversation changed from 'How do I escape?' to 'What can I achieve next?'. All of that has led me into my active lifestyle. I travel all over Europe for personal and competitive sports from ultra running to mountain climbing, from obstacle racing to CrossFit. I wish I would have had someone to help and guide me all those years ago and that is why I am here. I want you to benefit from my experience today and smash your own goals and expectations to achieve invincible results like I have. But what if I said you could turn the tide on your fitness in 12 weeks, not 13 years.

Just 12 weeks to see:
* huge performance gains in speed and strength; 
* shedding 10% body fat; 
* more energy;
* more confidence;
* and even a love of exercise!

I have been where you are so With my tailored programmes, we don't just focus on the physical, but also the mental and emotional well-being that are integral to a complete transformation. I believe in building sustainable habits that will last a lifetime and  invincible mind-sets that drive you to your own goals. No quick fixes or gimmicks, just hard work. All built around your life-style in a way that makes it achievable, manageable and fun. 

You're not just signing up for a workout plan, or someone counting your reps for an hour in the gym, you’re committing to a transformative experience that will reshape your body and revolutionise your mindset. I understand that every individual is unique, which is why our approach is personalised to suit your specific needs, preferences, and lifestyle.

Sounds great right? Its time commit to your own epic fitness with a coach who knows your struggles. Together, we'll work towards a healthier, more vibrant you, celebrating every milestone along the way.
